# Inventory-Management-case-study
This SQL case study explores inventory and sales data to uncover insights about product profitability, sales trends, employee performance, and customer behavior—using only SQL, without any visualization tools.

# Project Objective
- Analyze Profitability Trends across products, categories, and time periods.
- Track Sales Performance including monthly trends and year-over-year growth.
- Identify Operational Insights like high-performing employees and high-shipment cities.
- Detect Anomalies and Risks, such as loss-making products and cancelled orders.

# Dataset
- - <a href="https://github.com/Anish7000/Inventory-Management-case-study/blob/main/Inventory%20Dataset.csv">Dataset</a>

# Questions
- Which products generated the highest total profit?
- Monthly trend of total sales (Total Revenue = PerUnitPrice × OrderItemQuantity)
- Top product categories by average profit per item:
- Which employees handled the most total order quantity?
- Which cities have the highest number of orders shipped?
- Cancelled orders by product and region.
- List customers who made multiple orders (repeat customers)
- Average profit per unit sold for each product
- Determine the year-over-year growth in total sales:
- Identify products where the standard cost is higher than the selling price (potential loss)

  # SQL queries

# Project Outcomes
- Identified top-performing products and categories based on total and average profit.
- Analyzed monthly and yearly sales trends, revealing growth patterns over time.
- Discovered repeat customers, top employees by order volume, and top cities by shipments.
- Flagged loss-generating products and listed cancelled orders by product and region for further review.

# Conclusion
This SQL-based case study helped extract key business insights from the inventory dataset, allowing for better product, customer, and operations strategy. The project showcases how structured queries can reveal hidden trends, uncover inefficiencies, and support data-driven decision-making without relying on external visualization tools.
