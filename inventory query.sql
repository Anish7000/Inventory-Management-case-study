-- 1. Which products generated the highest total profit?
SELECT ProductName,
       SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit
FROM inventory_data
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY TotalProfit DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Monthly trend of total sales (Total Revenue = PerUnitPrice Ã— OrderItemQuantity):
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month,
       SUM(PerUnitPrice * OrderItemQuantity) AS MonthlyRevenue
FROM inventory_data
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;

-- 3. Top product categories by average profit per item:
SELECT CategoryName,
       AVG(Profit / NULLIF(OrderItemQuantity, 0)) AS AvgProfitPerItem
FROM inventory_data
GROUP BY CategoryName
ORDER BY AvgProfitPerItem DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 4. Which employees handled the most total order quantity?
SELECT EmployeeName,
       SUM(OrderItemQuantity) AS TotalItemsHandled
FROM inventory_data
GROUP BY EmployeeName
ORDER BY TotalItemsHandled DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 5. Which cities have the highest number of orders shipped?
SELECT City,
       COUNT(*) AS TotalShippedOrders
FROM inventory_data
WHERE Status = 'Shipped'
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY TotalShippedOrders DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 6. Cancelled orders by product and region
SELECT ProductName,
       RegionName,
       COUNT(*) AS CancelledOrders
FROM inventory_data
WHERE Status = 'Canceled'
GROUP BY ProductName, RegionName
ORDER BY CancelledOrders DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 7. List customers who made multiple orders (repeat customers):
SELECT CustomerName,
       COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM inventory_data
GROUP BY CustomerName
HAVING OrderCount > 1
ORDER BY OrderCount DESC;

-- 8. Average profit per unit sold for each product
SELECT ProductName,
       SUM(Profit) / SUM(OrderItemQuantity) AS AvgProfitPerUnit
FROM inventory_data
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY AvgProfitPerUnit DESC;

-- 9. Determine the year-over-year growth in total sales:
SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year,
       SUM(PerUnitPrice * OrderItemQuantity) AS TotalSales
FROM inventory_data
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate)
ORDER BY Year;

-- 10. Identify products where the standard cost is higher than the selling price (potential loss):
SELECT ProductName,
       ProductStandardCost,
       PerUnitPrice
FROM inventory_data
WHERE ProductStandardCost > PerUnitPrice;
